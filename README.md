# ghn
GitHub Notifications handler for desktop.

Right now it is a working in progress, but you can:
- show unread/read notification
- go to the link
- mark as read

## Why I created this

Basically I am a user that loves GH notification instead of mails and I like to be quick when a review need to be done or my mate comment my code, quick iteration, more fix, more quality more things done.

## What you can do for this project

Use it :). Raise issues or request of features, improve UI.
